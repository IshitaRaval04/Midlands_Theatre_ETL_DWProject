# Midlands_Theatre_ETL_DWProject
a comprehensive data warehouse project, taking it from initial conceptual design to a fully operational Data Mart using SQL! This project was a powerful demonstration of applied Dimensional Modeling and Database Development skills.

Here’s the breakdown in STAR format:

S: Situation
The Midlands Theatre required a robust analytical platform to move beyond simple transactional reporting. The existing OLTP system made complex performance tracking and strategic business intelligence incredibly challenging.

T: Task
My primary goal was to design, document, and fully implement a Star Schema Data Mart capable of transforming raw operational data into actionable insights for key decision-makers. This required end-to-end SQL coding, encompassing all DDL, ETL, and DML operations.

A: Action
Conceptual Design: I meticulously developed the Dimensional Model and associated Logical Relations (the theory backing found in the report), defining the necessary Fact and Dimension tables (e.g., Date, Theatre, Client, Ticket Sales) with clear granularity and chosen attributes.

Database Implementation (SQL): I then transitioned to coding, completing the entire process from start to finish.

Wrote the DDL (Data Definition Language) to create all dimension and fact tables, including implementing sequences and surrogate keys for enhanced Data Mart performance and integrity.

Developed the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) SQL scripts to map, cleanse, and populate the Data Mart from the source OLTP tables, ensuring data quality.

Coded Advanced Analytical Queries to answer specific business requirements (e.g., calculating monthly sales performance, identifying the highest-spending clients per theatre).

R: Result
I successfully delivered a fully functional Data Mart that provides a solid foundation for reporting, performance tracking, and strategic decision-making for the theatre. This project validated my ability to translate complex business requirements into a technically sound, insightful, and efficient data solution.
